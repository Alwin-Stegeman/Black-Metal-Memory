# Black-Metal-Memory
This is a black metal themed memory game with a few twists. The user plays against a computer player and both must find triplets of identical cards spread out over two game boards. Some cards are swapped after turning, some cards shuffle the complete board. The board size, computer memory strength, and turn order may be set. Winning is a challenge.

The game is programmed in C++ and played via a mouse controlled GUI, programmed using wxWidgets.
